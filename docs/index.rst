pySYD: |br| automated measurements |br| of global asteroseismic parameters
**************************************************************************

Asteroseismology, or the study of stellar oscillations, is a powerful tool
for studying the internal structure of stars and determining their fundamental 
properties. Specifically for stars similar to the Sun, turbulent near-surface 
convection excites sound waves that propagate within the stellar cavity, and hence
provides powerful constraints on stellar interiors that are inaccessible by 
any other means. While it is well-established and widely-accepted as the gold 
standard for the characterization of fundamental stellar properties (e.g., masses, radii,
ages, etc.), asteroseismology is a niche field and still mostly a closed-door science. 

In an effort to make asteroseismology more accessible to the broader astronomy
community, ``pySYD`` was developed as a Python package to automatically detect
solar-like oscillations and measure their global properties. Thus ``pySYD`` was
designed to be a hands-off, end-to-end tool so that even non-expert users can 
reap the benefits of asteroseismology without requiring substantial background 
knowledge. 

This package is being actively developed in 
`a public repository on GitHub <https://github.com/ashleychontos/pySYD>`_ -- we especially 
welcome and *encourage* any new contributions to help make ``pySYD`` better! Please see 
our :ref:`community guidelines <guidelines/index>` to find out how you can help. No contribution 
is too small!
