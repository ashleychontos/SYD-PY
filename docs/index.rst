pySYD: |br| automated measurements |br| of global asteroseismic parameters
**************************************************************************

Asteroseismology, or the study of stellar oscillations, is a powerful tool
for studying the internal structure of stars and determining their fundamental 
properties. For stars similar to the Sun, turbulent near-surface convection 
excites sound waves that propagate within the stellar cavity, and hence
provides powerful constraints on stellar interiors that are inaccessible by 
any other means. Asteroseismology is now widely-accepted as the gold 
standard for the characterization of fundamental stellar properties (e.g., 
masses, radii, ages, etc.). In an effort to make asteroseismology more 
accessible to the broader astronomy community, `pySYD` was developed as a 
Python package to automatically detect solar-like oscillations and characterize 
their global properties. 

.. important::

   The ``pySYD`` documentation is currently being revamped -- we apologize in advance
   for any inconveniences this may cause but appreciate your understanding!

This package is being actively developed in 
`a public repository on GitHub <https://github.com/ashleychontos/pySYD>`_ -- we especially 
welcome and *encourage* any new contributions to help make ``pySYD`` better! Please see 
our :ref:`community guidelines <guidelines-index>` to find out how you can help. No contribution 
is too small!
