pySYD: |br| Automated Measurements |br| of Global Asteroseismic Parameters
**************************************************************************

Asteroseismology, or the study of stellar oscillations, is a powerful tool
for studying the internal structure of stars and determining their fundamental 
properties. Specifically for stars similar to the Sun, turbulent near-surface 
convection excites sound waves that propagate within the stellar cavity, and hence
providing powerful constraints on stellar interiors that are inaccessible by 
any other means. While it is well-established and widely-accepted as the gold 
standard for characterizing fundamental stellar properties (e.g., masses, radii,
ages, etc.), asteroseismology is still mostly a niche field and closed-door science. 

In an effort to make asteroseismology more accessible to the broader astronomy
community, ``pySYD`` was established as a Python package to automatically detect
solar-like oscillations and measure their global asteroseismic parameters. Therefore, 
the outputs from ``pySYD`` can be used to determine precise and accurate stellar 
properties without the need for substantial background knowledge. In other words, 
``pySYD`` has been extensively tested and developed to be as hands-off as possible.

This package is being actively developed in 
`a public repository on GitHub <https://github.com/ashleychontos/pySYD>`_ -- we especially 
welcome and *encourage* any new contributions to help make ``pySYD`` better! Please see 
our `community guidelines <https://github.com/ashleychontos/pySYD/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ 
to find out how you can help. No contribution is too small!
