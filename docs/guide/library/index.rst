*****************
``pySYD`` library
*****************

Thanks for stopping by the ``pySYD`` documentation and showing an interest to
learn more about how the software (and asteroseismology) works -- we are absolutely 
*thrilled*! 

Since the intended target audience for ``pySYD`` is non-expert users, we developed 
the software while keeping in mind that it should be as hands-off as possible. 
**Therefore,** ``pySYD`` **was initially intended to be a strictly command-line, end-to-end tool.** 

However, we have also added so many awesome new features that can be enjoyed by even our
expert users so we've made sure to add as many examples as possible. 

Keep in mind that ``pySYD`` was originally intended to be ***solely*** a command-line tool 
but we are actively developing other channels and compatibilities. So while the :ref:`inputs<input>` 
and :ref:`outputs<output>` will remain the same, *how you choose to use* ``pySYD`` *is completely up to you!*
