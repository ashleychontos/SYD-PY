Thanks for stopping by the ``pySYD`` documentation and showing an interest to
learn more about how the software (and asteroseismology) works -- we are absolutely 
*thrilled*!

TL;DR
#####

The original target audience was for non-expert users and therefore, ``pySYD`` 
was initially developed to be a strictly command-line, end-to-end (i.e. hands-off) tool.
However, we have been actively developing other channels and compatibilities so more
folks are able to utilize the software.
