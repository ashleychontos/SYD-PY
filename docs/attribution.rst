Citing ``SYD``
**************

``pySYD`` is a python-based implementation of the IDL-based ``SYD`` pipeline, which was extensively
used to measure asteroseismic parameters for *Kepler* stars. Since ``pySYD`` adapted the well-tested 
framework from ``SYD``, we ask that you please cite `the original paper <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009CoAst.160...74H>`_ 
that discusses the asteroseismic analysis and methodology. 


.. important::

    **Citing et al.** |br| This work was only possible thanks to many powerful Python libraries
    -- we *strongly* encourage you to also consider citing :ref:`its dependencies <installation/dependencies>`.
