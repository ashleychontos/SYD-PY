.. note::

    ``pySYD`` is only possible thanks to many powerful Python libraries -- therefore
    we strongly encourage you to also cite :ref:`its dependencies <installation-dependencies>`.

Projects w/ ``pySYD``
=====================

We added a project thread in the public repository called `Projects w/ pySYD <https://github.com/ashleychontos/pySYD/discussions/28>`_.
Please consider adding to this in any way -- anything from early results, figures, student projects to published manuscripts, posters,
or any other ``pySYD``-related shoutouts. We would love to see firsthand what you are using ``pySYD`` for!
