    ``pySYD`` was initially the `Python` translation of the `IDL`-based asteroseismology pipeline ``SYD``, which was written 
    by my PhD advisor, Dan Huber, during his PhD in Sydney (hence the name). Therefore none of this would have been possible 
    without his i) years of hard work during his PhD as well as ii) years of patience during my PhD :)
    
    **A very special shoutout to Dan**


Collaborators

We have many amazing collaborators that have helped with the development of the software, especially with the 
improvements that have been implemented -- which have ultimately made ``pySYD`` more user-friendly. 

Many thanks to:
