asteroseismology
    the study of oscillations in stars


solar-like oscillations (p-mode oscillations)
    implied in the name, these oscillations are driven by the same mechanism as that observed in the Sun, which is
    due to turbulent, near-surface convection. They are also sometimes referred to as p-mode oscillations, after the
    pressure-driven (or acoustic sound) waves that are resonating in the stellar cavity.


global asteroseismic parameters
    the term 'global' is used to describe the general properties of the observed oscillations and is not associated with
    the detailed frequency analysis of individual oscillation modes, a process referred to as peakbagging. Traditionally
    the two main global asteroseismic properties are numax and dnu, both of which are described in more detail in their
    respective entry.
    
    there are two distinct features of solar-like oscillations that enable the measurement of the two main global 
    properties, numax and dnu. The stochastic nature of convection leads to oscillation modes over a range of frequencies, 
    where the envelope of the observed modes is approximately Gaussian and the frequency corresponding to the middle of
    peak of this Gaussian-like envelope is referred to as numax. The second feature is the comb pattern or regular spacing
    between different modes, which is referred to as the characteristic frequency spacing or dnu. Therefore, the term 'global' 
    is used to describe the general properties of the oscillations, like the center and amplitude of the Gaussian-like envelope. The second 
    distinct feature is the comb pattern or regular spacing between different modes, which is
    referred to as the characteristic frequency spacing or dnu. For purposes of our analyses, global asteroseismic 
    parameters regular spacing or combP-mode oscillations
    In addition 
    to the center of the frequency range (numax), there is a regular spacing or comb pattern between the observed modes 
    that is referred to as the characteristic spacing or dnu.


frequency of maximum power (numax)
    the frequency corresponding to maximum power, which is roughly the center of the Gaussian-like envelope of oscillations
    
    scales with evolutionary state, logg, acoustic cutoff

characteristic frequency separation (dnu)
    the comb patter or regular spacing observed for solar-like oscillations for different modes
    
    scales with mean stellar density


*Kepler* legacy sample
    a sample of well-studied, oscillating *Kepler* stars (cite)


``SYD``
    the well-known IDL-based asteroseismic pipeline created by Dan Huber during his PhD in Sydney (hence SYD). ``SYD``
    has been extensively tested and benchmarked to other closed-source asteroseismic tools on *Kepler* stars.
