    global properties
        the term 'global' is used to describe the general properties of the observed oscillations and is not associated with
        the detailed frequency analysis of individual oscillation modes, a process referred to as peakbagging. Traditionally
        the two main global asteroseismic properties are :math:`\nu_{\mathrm{max}}` and :math:`\Delta\nu`, both of which are 
        described in more detail in their respective entry.
    
        there are two distinct features of solar-like oscillations that enable the measurement of the two main global 
        properties, numax and dnu. The stochastic nature of convection leads to oscillation modes over a range of frequencies, 
        where the envelope of the observed modes is approximately Gaussian and the frequency corresponding to the middle of
        peak of this Gaussian-like envelope is referred to as numax. The second feature is the comb pattern or regular spacing
        between different modes, which is referred to as the characteristic frequency spacing or dnu. Therefore, the term 'global' 
        is used to describe the general properties of the oscillations, like the center and amplitude of the Gaussian-like envelope. The second 
        distinct feature is the comb pattern or regular spacing between different modes, which is
        referred to as the characteristic frequency spacing or dnu. For purposes of our analyses, global asteroseismic 
        parameters regular spacing or combP-mode oscillations
        In addition 
        to the center of the frequency range (numax), there is a regular spacing or comb pattern between the observed modes 
        that is referred to as the characteristic spacing or dnu.

    p-mode oscillations
    solar-like oscillations
        implied in the name, these oscillations are driven by the same mechanism as that observed in the Sun, which is
        due to turbulent, near-surface convection. They are also sometimes referred to as **p-mode oscillations**, after the
        pressure-driven (or acoustic sound) waves that are resonating in the stellar cavity.
