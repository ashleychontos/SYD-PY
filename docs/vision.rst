*******************************
Vision of the ``pySYD`` project
*******************************

The NASA space telescopes *Kepler*, K2 and TESS have recently
provided very large databases of high-precision light curves of stars.
By detecting brightness variations due to stellar oscillations, these
light curves allow the application of asteroseismology to large numbers
of stars, which requires automated software tools to efficiently extract
observables. 

Several tools have been developed for asteroseismic analyses, but many of 
them are closed-source and therefore inaccessible to the general astronomy 
community. Some open-source tools exist, but they are either optimized for 
smaller samples of stars or have not yet been extensively tested against 
closed-source tools. 


.. note::

    We've attempted to collect these tools in a :ref:`single place <library-about-related>` 
    for easy comparisons. Please let us know if we've somehow missed yours --
    we would be happy to add it!

 
Goals
#####

The initial vision of this project was intended to be a direct translation of 
the IDL-based ``SYD`` pipeline
