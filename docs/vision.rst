*******************************
Vision of the ``pySYD`` project
*******************************

We borrowed and adapted this from `Lightkurve <https://docs.lightkurve.org/about/vision.html>`_ since it was perfectly worded:

 > This page summarizes the vision of the ``pySYD`` project. This document aims to be a reference 
 > to aid making decisions on the features, design, or future of the package. This vision is not 
 > set in stone, anyone is invited to open a GitHub issue to discuss or revise any aspects of it.
