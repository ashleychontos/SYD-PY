# Summary

Asteroseismology, the study of stellar oscillations, is a powerful tool for studying the interiors of stars
and determining their fundamental properties [@aerts2021]. For stars with temperatures that are similar to 
the Sun, turbulent near-surface convection excites sound waves that propagate within the stellar cavity 
[@bedding2014]. These waves penetrate into different depths within the star and therefore provide powerful 
constraints on stellar interiors that would otherwise be inaccessible. Asteroseismology is well-established 
in astronomy as the gold standard for characterizing fundamental properties like masses, radii, densities, 
and ages for single stars, which has broad impacts on several fields in astronomy. For example, ages of stars 
are important to reconstruct the formation history of the Milky Way (so-called galactic archeology). For 
exoplanets that are discovered indirectly through changes in stellar observables, precise and accurate stellar 
masses and radii are critical for learning about the planets that orbit them. 

`pySYD` is a Python package for detecting solar-like oscillations and measuring global asteroseismic parameters given an input
power spectrum. Derived parameters include seismic observables $\rm \nu_{max}$ and $\Delta\nu$, which are directly tied
to the surface gravity and density of the star [@kjeldsen1995]. `pySYD` also performs a maximum likelihood estimation for 
determining the stellar background contribution, characterizing different time scales and amplitudes of granulation 
processes. 

# Statement of Need

The NASA space telescopes *Kepler*, K2 and TESS have recently provided very large databases of high-precision light curves 
of stars. By detecting brightness variations due to solar-like oscillations, these light curves allow the application of 
asteroseismology to large numbers of stars, which requires automated software tools to efficiently extract observables. 
Several tools have been developed for asteroseismic analyses [e.g., `A2Z`, @mathur2010; `COR`, @mosser2009; `OCT`, @hekker2010; 
`SYD`, @huber2009], but most of them are closed-source and thus inaccessible to the general astronomy community. Some open-source 
tools exist [e.g., `DIAMONDS` and `FAMED`, @corsaro2014; `PBjam`, @nielsen2021; `lightkurve`, @lightkurve], but they are either 
optimized for smaller samples of stars or have not yet been extensively tested against closed-source tools.

`pySYD` is adapted from the framework of the IDL-based `SYD` pipeline [@huber2009; hereafter referred to as `IDL-SYD`], which has 
been used frequently to measure asteroseismic parameters for *Kepler* stars and has been extensively tested against other closed-source 
tools on *Kepler* data [@verner2011;@hekker2011]. Papers based on asteroseismic parameters measured from `IDL-SYD` include @huber2011, 
@bastien2013, @chaplin2014, @serenelli2017, and @yu2018. `pySYD` was developed using the same methodology as `IDL-SYD`, but comes with 
many new enhancements including automated background model selection as well as parallel processing. The improved flexibility of the 
software makes it more accessible to the broader astronomy community by providing many new, optional features to obtain optimal results 
while still maintaining its speed and efficiency. Well-documented, open-source asteroseismology software that has been benchmarked against 
closed-source tools are critical to ensure the reproducibility of legacy results from the *Kepler* mission [@borucki2010]. Additionally, the 
combination of the well-tested methodology and improved accessibility makes `pySYD` a promising tool to analyze current and forthcoming data 
from the NASA TESS mission [@ricker2015].

# The `pySYD` library

The excitation mechanism for solar-like oscillations is stochastic and modes are observed over a range of frequencies. 
Oscillation modes are separated by the so-called large frequency spacing ($\Delta\nu$), with an approximately
Gaussian-shaped power excess centered on $\rm \nu_{max}$, the frequency of maximum power. The observables 
$\rm \nu_{max}$ and $\Delta\nu$ are directly related to fundamental stellar properties such as surface gravity, 
density, mass and radius [@kjeldsen1995].

A `pySYD` pipeline `Target` class object has two main methods:

- `Target.find_excess()` searches for the power excess due to solar-like oscillations by implementing a frequency-resolved 
  collapsed autocorrelation method.  The output from this routine provides an estimate for $\rm \nu_{max}$. 
- `Target.fit_background()` starts by optimizing and determining the best-fit stellar background model. The results from the 
  first module are translated into a frequency range in the power spectrum centered on the estimated $\rm \nu_{max}$,
  which is masked out to determine the stellar background contribution. After subtracting the best-fit model from 
  the power spectrum, the peak of the smoothed power spectrum is used to estimate $\rm \nu_{max}$. An autocorrelation 
  function is computed using the region centered on $\rm \nu_{max}$, and used to calculate an estimate for $\Delta\nu$. 
  
The `pySYD` software depends on a number of powerful libraries, including Astropy [@astropy1;@astropy2], 
Matplotlib [@matplotlib], Numpy [@numpy], and SciPy [@scipy]. 

# Comparison to Closed-source `IDL-SYD`

How is it different? How is it the same?

Initially intended as a direct translation from IDL to Python, `pySYD` inherits all of the core operations and
techniques that made `IDL-SYD` successful.

`pySYD` has been tested against `IDL-SYD` using results from the *Kepler* sample for differing time series 
lengths (\autoref{fig:comparison}). The comparisons show no significant systematic differences, with a median 
offset and scatter of $0.2\%$ and $0.5\%$ for $\rm \nu_{max}$ as well as $0.01\%$ and $0.2\%$ for $\Delta\nu$, 
which is smaller or comparable to the typical random uncertainties [@huber2011].

fractional residuals.\label{fig:comparison}](comparison_new.png)

# Documentation & Examples

The main documentation for the `pySYD` software is hosted at [pysyd.readthedocs.io](https://pysyd.readthedocs.io). 
`pySYD` provides a convenient setup feature that will download data for three example stars and automatically create 
the recommended files for an easy quickstart. The features of the `pySYD` output results are described in detail in 
the documentation.
