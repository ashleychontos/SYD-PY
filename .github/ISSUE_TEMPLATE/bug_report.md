## Relevant Materials

### Description

What's happening -- is the code crashing completely or are you seeing unexpected output? If it's an error, what does it say (feel free to provide screenshots)? At what step does the problem occur? When this happens, are you using the software via command line or within scripts? Is the issue specific to the software version? In other words, has it worked for you before? If so, do you know what version it last worked with (approximate is ok too)? 

Is this already a known problem? If so, has there already been a proposed workaround or solution? Did you happen to identify a temporary workaround or solution? If yes, will you be submitting a pull request to address this? (please link the two if you do!)
